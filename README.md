# PythonNeuralNetsFromScratch
This repository is my study record, developed as I progressed through the Udemy course titled "Build Neural Networks In Python From Scratch. Step By Step!" It's intended for anyone interested in a detailed, hands-on approach to understanding neural networks, starting from the fundamentals and advancing through complex concepts <br/>

## What You'll Find Here
PythonNeuralNetsFromScratch documents each stage of my learning, inspired by the aforementioned Udemy course. The repository provides practical Python code examples for each concept taught in the course, offering insights into the building blocks of neural networks. Here's what the repository covers: <br/>

**Linear Regression**: Begin with simple predictive models <br/>
**Real Data Application**: Implement these models on actual datasets, highlighting the nuances of real-world data <br/>
**Classification Techniques**: Learn to distinguish data into categories <br/>
**Multiclass Classification**: Extend classification to scenarios involving multiple outcomes <br/>
**Incorporating Hidden Layers**: Explore the depth of neural networks by adding multiple layers <br/>
**Initializations of Random Weights**: Examine how different initialization strategies affect learning outcomes <br/>
**Recognition of Handwritten Digits**: Apply your skills to a classic machine learning challenge using the MNIST dataset <br/>

## Purpose of This Repository
The primary aim here is to meticulously track and share the learning process as I build various types of neural networks from scratch, following step-by-step guidance from the course <br/>
This repository not only serves as a personal record but also as an educational resource for others who are on a similar journey <br/>
